I put this text file here to make the roadmap readily accessible.

As of right now our goals are:

V1: (test build)

1. Add day night cycle (to familiarize ourselves with the program)
2. Add global aspect ratio scaling
3. Add essential interfaces island, fighting unit, building, along with class flag
4. Add user interface and launch ability
5.

NOTE: THE RESOLUTION ON (MY) MAC IS 1792 * 1120
